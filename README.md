# AStar-CLCS-PyJ
Python & Java implementation of A* for Constrained Longest Common Subsequence (CLCS)

## Overview
This project implements the A* algorithm for solving the Constrained Longest Common Subsequence problem, based on the C++ implementation described in the paper:

***"An A\* search algorithm for the constrained longest common subsequence problem"***
by Marko Djukanovic, Christoph Berger, GÃ¼nther R. Raidl, Christian Blum

[DOI: 10.1016/j.ipl.2020.106041](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2020.106041)

The repository includes:
- A* Algorithm implementation
- Deorowicz's Dynamic Programming solution (as a reference for result validation)

## Key Observations
- Results may differ between A* and DP solutions, as multiple strings can satisfy the CLCS problem. However, the CLCS length should always be the same.
- A* outperforms DP for very long input strings.
- For shorter strings, DP solutions may be preferred due to lower initialization overhead.
